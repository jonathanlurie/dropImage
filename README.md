# dropImage

## What does it do?
It sends a file to your dropbox account, in a subfolder system that is automatically arranged by year/month/day.  
When you drop the image, it returns a direct link to it as a *raw* data (meaning, you can embed it to a website).

## Why would I do that?
You might be interested to drop an image and get a link if you blog with a system using Dropbox instead of a database. Among them:

- [Scriptogr.am](http://scriptogr.am)
- [Calepin.co](http://calepin.co)
- [JustWriting](https://github.com/hjue/JustWriting)

The two first are free online services and the last must be hosted on you own server.  
On those three plateforms, your blog is hosted on your Dropbox (a subfolder of it), so you might not want to deal with uploading your images on a diferent service of server. In order to stay with Dropbox only, lets upload the images on your Dropbox!

> **« Yep, but I can do it manually! »**

You can. Or you can use DropImage and quickly upload + get a link + copy to clipboard a Markdown sentence for displaying your image in your blog post.

## What do you need?
- A Dropbox account
- To register your own Dropbox App [(here)](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create) 

The second will create a dedicated subfolder in your Dropbox, where you will put your images (and posts if you use *JustWriting*)

## TODO

- Add a Markdown link to image
- Add auto copy Mardown to clipboard
